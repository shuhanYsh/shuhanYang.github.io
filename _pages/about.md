I am a highly motivated candidate with a solid foundation in statistics and data science. I recently earned my [Master of Science in Business Analytics](https://foster.uw.edu/academics/degree-programs/master-science-business-analytics/) from the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), following a Bachelor's degree in [Statistics](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/) from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). 

My research interests focus on data mining, statistical modeling, machine learning, and their applications in data-driven decision-making. Currently, I am actively applying for PhD programs for Fall 2025 and look forward to deepening my expertise in these areas.
